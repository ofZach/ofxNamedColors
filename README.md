ofxNamedColors
==============

this comes from

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors_(compact)

with some modifications to the names to let them work as variable names.  there's about 900+ named colors.

also, this is just a first pass -- I will re-organize how this is setup shortly to use static const, like this:
